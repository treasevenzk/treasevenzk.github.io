### Motivation
* Heuristic-based loop order selection can lead to lower performance
* Best-performing loop order changes across problem sizes
* Best-performing loop order changes across tile sizes
* Both tile size and loop order together influence the performance
* Best-performing tile size changes across problem sizes
* Best-performing tile size changes across prefetch configurations


### Tile size and Loop order selection problem
#### Hierarchical Classification

* A Tuned Hierarchical Classifier <br>
(1) loops that are parallel in the i/j-dimension
(2) tile size to be one among the group

* A Systematica Approach for Classifier Design
