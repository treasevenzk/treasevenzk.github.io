### Motivation
- Portability(the ability to transfer a program from one hardware environment to another)
- Performance(latency-sensitive and resource-constrained tasks)
- Expressiveness(clear and accurate data abstraction, computation abstraction, and representation of data flow and computation dependencies)


### Methodology
- address portability issues through intermediate abstraction
- propose domain-specific abstractions and unified abstraction for high-level applications
- reuse existing frameworks and compilers to reduce engineering cost
- use multi-level optimizations to guarantee performance
