### Background
Compilers apply program transformations in order to exploit hardware parallelism and memory hierarchy. They fail to exploit the natural robustness of neural networks.<br>
Neural architecture search(NAS) mutate networks by operations, exploiting the resilience of DNNs.

### Our Approach
combine neural architecture and compiler optimization in a unified framework
